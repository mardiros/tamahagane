# tamahagane

Forge your application registries.

Tamahagane is a library designed for constructing application registries,
the essential foundation for building decoupled software architectures
and enabling unit testing on application handlers.

## Motivation

Tamahagane essentially serves as a modern alternative to Venusian,
fulfilling the same core functionality.

The decision to create a new library stems from Venusian's limitations:
it was originally built for Python 2, relies heavily on dynamic behavior,
and lacks type support.

Tamahagane reuse the same vocabular, a Scanner and an attach function,
but the API is not fully compatible, in order to get a simpler version.
